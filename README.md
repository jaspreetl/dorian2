Dorian is a coffee-focused e-commerce platform built from scratch with the MERN stack. The public site is a React frontend offering product browsing, filtering/sorting, variant selection (size/grind/color), cart and checkout flows. The backend is Node.js + Express with Mongoose/MongoDB for product, user, and transaction data; an admin dashboard provides inventory and product management. Deployed frontends are on Vercel (frontend & admin), source is on GitHub, and Stripe integration for payments is planned.
